TODO:
1. Limelight doesn't actually turn off
2. Turret Aim() in Shoot.cpp needs a lot of work. PID is a mess maybe look into using encoder or motion magic??
3. Servos did not respond to Set(). Maybe use SetAngle()?
4. Channel class add photogate to know when to stop intaking balls
5. Intake class I've added the pneumatics, but perhaps in Robot.cpp RobotPeriodic() I have to add recompressing
6. Drive class State needs to be updated to put Talons on Brake mode when the robot is IDLE
7. Climb class - I only added skeleton stucture
8. Refactor, things are turning into a mess 

UPDATES:
1. Manual Mode bool value on dashboard
2. Add Intake, Climb, & Channel files
3. // Testing() in Controls
4. Controls now has working intake now we need to build it
5. Should now be Auto mode where robo just backs up slowly
